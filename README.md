# Social Network API with Mongo

## Description

Social networking is a massive part of today's society and for the most part, if you're not on social media, your friends might not be able to keep in touch with what you're doing. In this app we aim to make a backend social media solution using, Node, Express, Mongo, and Javascript. Part of being a fully capable MERN developer is being able to use Mongo, Express and Node and in this app, all of those are put to the test. 

A user has the ability to create a profile, add friends, add 'thoughts' and 'reactions' (similar to making posts and replies on regular social media sites), as well as adding friends, deleting posts/friends/reactions/and their own account if they need a break from the social aspect of social media. This project really put into perspective another way to tackle databases, where MySQL and Sequelize are more SQL driven, Mongo is a NoSQL driven technology. With a little front end manipulation, a web developer can understand how much work goes behind the development of a big social media site like Facebook.
